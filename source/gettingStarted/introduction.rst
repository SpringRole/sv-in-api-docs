Introduction
============

Welcome to SpringVerify India APIs. We provide endpoints for user verification. The endpoints exposed in this documentation are to collect user information,
which you want to verify. Example: National ID, past employements or past educations.

The SpringVerify India API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form request JSON bodies, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

.. note::
   This documentation is intended for developers only.


Environment Urls
----------------

We currently have two environments, development and production. Both the environments have separate databases. During development base url of development environment must be used.
